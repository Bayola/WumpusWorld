WumpusWorld
===========

Python implementation of the Wumpus World game that uses Artificial logical reasoning to assume game state spaces and attempts to traverse the world successfully without dying to the Wumpus.

This project uses propositional knowledge bases(KB) and queries this KB using resolution to see if anything can be inferred from the new propositional logic.
